[The Surprising Creativity of Digital Evolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03453.pdf)

The process of evolution is an algorithmic process that transcends the substrate in which it occurs.

Independent of its physical medium, evolution can happen wherever replication, variation, and selection intersect [16, 17]. Thus, evolution can be instantiated digitally [18, 19], as a computer program, either to study evolution experimentally or to solve engineering challenges through directed digital breeding

As noted by Daniel Dennett, “evolution will occur
whenever and wherever three conditions are met: replication, variation (mutation), and differential fitness
(competition)” [34]; no particular molecule (e.g. DNA or RNA) or substrate (e.g. specific physical
embodiment) is required.

1. Initial population
2. Performance test
3. Random mutation & combination
4. Repeat 2 & 3

Bit strings can be decoded to any representation

Genetic usually high probability of recombination (95-99%) and low probability of mutation

Fitness selection shouldn't be too greedy
